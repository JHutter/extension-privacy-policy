# extension-privacy-policy

## Intro

Effective Date: October 9, 2024

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled and protected in my Google Chrome extensions.

## Data Collection

No data is collected or sent by the extension(s). No data is distributed or sold to third parties.

## Extension-Specific

The extension "Page Not Found - Redirect Utility for Confluence" temporarily saves Confluence urls in your browser session storage, for use in redirecting your tab when hitting the Page Not Found error in Confluence. This data persists only as long as your browser session. See https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage, section storage.session for more information.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If there are substantive changes made to this privacy policy, the affected extension(s) will be updated.

## Feedback

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please [file an issue](https://github.com/jhutter/extension-privacy-policy/issues/new) to this repository.
